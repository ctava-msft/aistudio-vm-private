# Azure AI Studio Private Endpoints Setup

[![Deploy To Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fctava-msft%2Faistudio-vm-private%2Fmain%2Fazuredeploy.json)

Azure AI Studio is built on Azure Machine Learning as the primary resource provider and takes a dependency on the Cognitive Services (Azure AI Services) resource provider to surface model-as-a-service endpoints for Azure Speech, Azure Content Safety, and Azure OpenAI service. An 'Azure AI hub' is a special kind of 'Azure Machine Learning workspace', that is kind = "hub".

A VM is added as a connected compute resource for secure use of Azure OpenAI Service.

## Resources

The following table describes the resources created in the deployment:

| Provider and type | Description |
| - | - |
| `Microsoft.Compute` | `An Azure VM Compute` |
| `Microsoft.CognitiveServices` | `An Azure AI Services as the model-as-a-service endpoint provider` |
| `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices` | `An Azure AI Hub` |

## Commands to generate files from main.bicep:

Generate ARM Template from bicep file:

```
az bicep build --file <your-bicep-file>.bicep
```

Generate azuredeploy.json:
```
bicep build main.bicep --outfile azuredeploy.json
```
azuredeploy.parameters.json was copied over from another file.
